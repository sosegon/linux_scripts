Hi there,

I think I am the perfect candidate to fill the position. I am a professional in software development, who has worked in different types of projects. I have evolved over the last years to acquire the necessary skills to be part of projects like yours.

My profile fits your needs [1]. I am person able to adapt to existing projects, learn what is already done, and adapt existing work to create new features or modify existing ones. I am also able to use existing work to create something new.

Specifically, I modified an educational android application called Anki to integrate gamification elements [2]. In this project, I successfully integrate new features to the application by applying the MVP pattern in a project that used a distinct architecture. In the same project, I also modified a casual game made with React [3]. The modified game was integrated into the Android application to develop the gamification strategy [4].

The modified game served as the basis for another project. In this case, I created a casual game using React and Redux [5]. In this project, I also wrote the corresponding documentation [6]. Then, I used the existing code to make an analysis of the performance of the AI algorithms [7].

Finally, I also used the existing work for a chrome extension to create a new one that does image processing [8]. In this case, I explored several alternatives to implement the required features. I ended up implementing the new features completely in Javascript. I recently refactored the code to facilitate scalability and collaboration [8].

As seen, I have the required skills to become part of a fully functional team. My objective is to collaborate in a team to deliver great products based on a plan and a schedule.

I'll be happy to attend to an interview.

Sincerely,
Sebastian Velasquez
